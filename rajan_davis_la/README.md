# The (Conditional) Cost of Quality

This presentation investigates the relationship between the Sale Price and Overall Quality and Conditions of houses built in Ames, Iowa between 1872 and 2010 and sold on the market between 2006 and 2010.

The questions I looked to answer were:

1. As quality goes up, what effect would that have on sale price?
2. Are newer houses worth more?
3. Are there relationships between when a house was built and how much it sold for?
4. Are there relationships between when a house was built, how much it sold for, and it's rated quality?
5. What effect does the overall condition have on sale price?
6. Are newer houses in better condition than older houses and how does this relate to sales price?
